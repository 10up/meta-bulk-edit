Map a meta field to a CPT for quick-edit & bulk-edit capabilities.

== Description ==

Previously, there was no easy way to add a custom meta field to the Post (or Custom Post Type) admin listing for integration with the Quick Edit & Bulk Edit functionality.

This plugin does just that. Simply specify which meta key (as seen in the wp_postmeta table) you want to quick / bulk edit and it works.

Please note that at the moment, only one meta key can be added to one post type.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `meta-bulk-edit` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Modify the $meta_settings variable in meta_bulk_edit.php
